# Submarine Communication Cables

Submarine cables form the backbone of global communications, transmitting nearly all international data traffic across oceans. These undersea fiber-optic cables link continents, enabling instant connectivity for businesses, governments, and individuals worldwide. While satellites and wireless technologies play a role in modern communication, submarine cables remain the most reliable and efficient means of transmitting vast amounts of data with minimal latency. Despite their crucial role, these cables often go unnoticed, buried deep beneath the ocean’s surface. Their construction, maintenance, and environmental impact present unique challenges that have evolved over time. As the world becomes increasingly dependent on high-speed internet and global connectivity, understanding the infrastructure, history, and future of submarine cabling is essential. This paper explores the origins of submarine cables, their technological advancements, and their role in shaping the modern digital world.

## History 

The history of submarine cabling dates back to the mid-19th century with the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1858. Initially made of copper and insulated with gutta-percha, early cables faced durability issues and short operational lifespans. The first truly reliable transatlantic cable, laid in 1866, revolutionized global communication by reducing transatlantic message transmission from weeks to minutes. Over time, technological improvements led to coaxial cables in the 20th century, allowing telephone conversations to be transmitted across oceans. The introduction of fiber-optic technology in the 1980s further transformed submarine cabling, dramatically increasing data capacity and reliability. Today, fiber-optic cables spanning over 1.4 million kilometers connect the world, supporting everything from financial transactions to streaming services. Despite advances, challenges such as undersea maintenance, geopolitical concerns, and physical damage from natural disasters and human activity continue to impact the industry.

## Infrastructure

The submarine cables that move internet traffic around the world are made from silica glass fiber optic strands. The G.654 subset of fiber is mainly used for underwater applications and widely accepted according to international standards. These cables allow light to travel long distances with minimal attenuation. These cables make use of the Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) to move large amounts of data by allowing multiple different data streams in the form of wavelengths of light to be sent simultaneously over a single fiber infrastructure. Submarine optical fibers are typically G.654A-D and G.654E fibers are typically used for more land based applications. 

As of early 2025, there is estimated to be over 1.5 kilometers of submarine cables currently in service globally. Estimated maintenance costs total over $100 million to $500 million dollars per year globally. Cost depends on several factors such as cable length, location, and risk factors such as earthquakes or undersea landslides. On average there are about 200 faults each year. Accidents like fishing vessels and ships dragging anchors account for almost two thirds of all cable faults. Maintenance costs of these cables are usually shared amongst the tech companies that own them (e.g., Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon). They all contribute to and pay their share of the maintenance fees ensuring the protection of the cables and global internet stability. Maintenance of these fiber optic cables also include constant monitoring. Companies use fiber-optic sensors to detect anomalies like increased latency or packet loss. Some cables have built in seismic sensors to help detect and predict undersea earthquakes that could possibly shift or damage the cables.  

## Alternatives

For many years submarine communication cables were the only reliable and fast way to send network signals. Alternatives like satellite and high-frequency radio links could send network signals but at much lower speeds with lower capacity. However, in recent times there have been many developments in interconnected global communication that could drastically change how network signals are sent across long distances.

Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have recently become a popular alternative to submarine communication cables. Unlike geostationary satellites that orbit the Earth at 22,000 miles, LEO satellites only orbit Earth at around 1,000 miles. This in turn allows for network signals to be sent much faster than regular satellite communication, 20-40ms for LEO satellites in comparison to 600ms with geostationary satellites. These speeds also tend to be faster than even submarine cables which send and receive signals at around 60ms. SpaceX’s Starlink and Amazon’s Kuiper are currently the leaders in the space, with SpaceX already having deployed 5,500 LEO satellites. Currently, the lack of infrastructure and the high operating costs of LEO satellites keep them from competing with submarine communication cables, however, once LEO satellites become cheaper and the infrastructure is more widespread then it is entirely possible we could see a shift away from submarine cables and more into satellite communication.

Other alternatives to submarine cables include: Quantum Communication, Optical Communication (Space-Based Lasers), and Neutrino Communication. Quantum and Neutrino based communication could be useful in encrypting data, while Optical communication could deliver higher speeds. However, these forms of network communication are still under development and haven’t had a significant presence in the space.

## Environmental Impact

Submarine cables have a generally low impact on the surrounding environment, but can still be harmful in certain ways. Laying cables can disturb seafloor habitats, especially in coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and deep-sea ecosystems. The installation and maintenance of cables requires machinery that produces sound waves or electromagnetic waves. This can negatively affect marine life that depend on these waves as a form of communication and sensing. Also some cables may require trenching, which can permanently alter a deep-sea ecosystem. 

However, submarine cables generally have a more positive impact on the environment in comparison to other forms of network communication. Satellites require a lot of energy to send and receive signals and require power intensive ground stations and space launches. Also, cables can serve as artificial reefs and aren’t very harmful to the surrounding environment due to not having many pollutants.   

## Conclusion
	
Submarine communication cables are an effective and fast way to send network signals over a long distance. Although technologies like Low Earth Orbit satellites aim to compete in network communication, submarine cables are here to stay. Their low environmental impact, relatively low cost and vast infrastructure make them a mainstay in long distance network communication.
